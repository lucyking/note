No current version of Ubuntu can run on the Raspberry Pi. Ubuntu only support later ARM architectures.

Debian soft-float is no longer available for download from raspberrypi.org. **The last version** they had is mirrored at ftp://ftp.mirrorservice.org/sites/downloads.raspberrypi.org/images/debian/7/2013-05-29-wheezy-armel/2013-05-29-wheezy-armel.zip

Raspbian (rather cheekily called Debian Wheezy) is a recompilation of the Debian packages for hard-float. It is not soft-float and as far as I'm aware is not supported by Debian.

There is another good tool: Microsoft Rogue DHCP Server detection 1.0 that could help.
